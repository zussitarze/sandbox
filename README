Erlang inspired bytesyntax library for Racket.

A syntax extension implementing a subset of Erlang's bit/byte syntax, to allow for convenient construction and deconstruction of racket byte-strings. See example.rkt for a demonstration of it's use.

Caveat Emptor: While this library is intended to be useful, it's creation was primarily motivated by the author's desire to explore the syntax/parse meta-library.
