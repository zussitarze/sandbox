Simple forward search planner.  

Uses Racket macros to specify planning domains, which are then solved using a forward search algorithm.
The domain consists of constants and actions. With the latter, acting on the former.  Each action 
has a set of preconditions and state changing effects.

If the problem domain can be solved, the planner prints out the required sequence of steps.
